<p>
   <br>1. url参数可以通过用户查询接口得到（profile字段），但需要用utf8字符集对profile进行编码
   <br>2. 由于Linkedin平台本身信息的丰富性以及用户注册信息的特点，每个用户的信息可能呈现出各自不同的特点（比如用户A中拥有的字段在用户B中不一定能够找到），但每个用户信息的数据结构基本上是一致的。

In 2008, I put many of my ideas about the future of China's economy into a book, Supertrends of Future China, which was published during the Beijing Olympics and co-written with Dr. James Yuann. In 2012, I published China's Economic Supertrends, the first in a three book series which will later include demographic and political supertrends. Based on my book research and insights, I have provided market research for various business needs including demographic, urbanization and sustainability trends. As a corporate trainer, I am Training Director at InChina Corporate Training (ICT). This means that I am responsible for instructor selection and training, curriculum development, and I also coach and train for our clients. In addition I've been teaching MBA and undergraduate courses in business administration since 2005 as an adjunct professor. I teach cross-culture management, doing business in China and understanding China's economy, and organizational behavior. I have completed consulting projects for both mainland Chinese companies and western foreign companies, assisting them with China strategy planning. I've been in mainland China for more than eleven years now and in Asia for more than fifteen years. I have excellent spoken and written Mandarin and Japanese.

The successes found by those implementing the original ideas from 2008 to 2012 prompted readers to ask about the origins, implications and potential of the China Supertrends from 2012 until the end of China's Olympic Decade in 2018. This book, China's Economic Supertrends, is the answer to those queries. The first of three volumes (the other two volumes to follow later in 2012), China's Economic Supertrends examines in-depth the origins of the China Supertrends, the current implications and future development from now until 2018. China's Economic Supertrends is written with an informative and analytical style that will help readers understand the reasons why China's economy has been able to grow for the past 30 years and why it will continue to grow, becoming the world's largest economy by 2018. It will also show the economic-specific implications of the supertrends, and discuss how they will continue to develop in 2012 onward. The book expands upon the model from the original book, covering the growth engines of China's economy, the turbochargers, and the economic supertrends. The turbochargers of China's economy are powering a reversal in the direction of many of the forces of globalization. What used to be a west to east flow of capital, culture and people is now increasingly an east-to-west phenomenon. At the same time, China is leapfrogging over old technologies and ways of doing things to begin leading the world.
